POAP's for Grants Round 13 : Design Submission by Kavish Sethi (discord: kavishsethi#2327)

Inspired by MoonshotBots, created an astronaut & a space shuttle to use them as elements of space in juxtaposition with the GRANTs logo combined with the color theme and values of GITCOIN. The Crown is used as a symbol of victory and triumph. The following are three POAPs designed for GRANTS with roman numbers and the other three for DGRANTS with standard English numbers. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks
